# Wordsmith

A minimal terminal markdown editor — inspired by [WordGrinder](https://cowlark.com/wordgrinder/) and built for distraction-free prose writing.

Wordsmith is designed for writers who keep notes and blog posts in markdown (e.g., in an Obsidian vault) and want a keyboard-driven, zen terminal experience for focused writing.


## Features

- **Markdown syntax highlighting** — special styling for bold, italic, headers, links, code, blockquotes, lists, and frontmatter
- **Zen writing mode** — centered content column with configurable width
- **Autosave** — auto-saving with atomic writes
- **Session persistence** — remembers your last opened file for seamless resume
- **Fuzzy file finder** — `Ctrl+P` to quickly search and open any markdown file in your vault, or create new files
- **File tree sidebar** — `Ctrl+E` to browse your vault directory structure, press `n` to create a new file
- **Markdown hotkeys** — `Ctrl+B` bold, `Ctrl+I` italic, `Ctrl+K` link insertion
- **Word counter** — live word count in the status bar
- **Undo/Redo** — `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` with coalesced character grouping


## Install

```bash
go install github.com/tupini07/wordsmith@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tupini07/wordsmith
cd wordsmith
go build -o wordsmith .
```

## Usage

```bash
# Open a specific file
wordsmith path/to/file.md
